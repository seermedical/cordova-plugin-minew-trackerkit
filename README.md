Minew-TrackerKit
======

THIS PLUGIN IS IN DEVELOPMENT. It very likely will not work and you definitely shouldn't use it.

From Cordova plugin template from here https://github.com/rrostt/cordova-plugin-template
A Cordova plugin on iOS and Android to communicate with the Minew TrackerKit Framework

# iOS Plugin
- Satisfactory performance for a first draft / baseline
- Still some TODOs (see Wiki), and error handling needed

# Android Plugin
- Can add frameworks via plugin
- startScan, bind and log on click is working (but messy because I put it all in a scan loop!)
